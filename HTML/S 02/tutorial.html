HTML Links
    Links are found in nearly all web pages. Links allow users to click their way from page to page.

    HTML Links - Hyperlinks
    HTML links are hyperlinks.

    You can click on a link and jump to another document.

    When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.

    Note:   - A link does not have to be text. 
            - A link can be an image or any other HTML element!

    Syntax:
        <a href="url">link text</a>

    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">Visit W3Schools.com!</a>
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">
        Visit W3Schools.com!
    </a>
    
    <a href="helloPage.html"> Link Two </a>
    <a href="helloPage.html">
        Link Two 
    </a>


    By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:
        - An unvisited link is underlined and blue
        - A visited link is underlined and purple
        - An active link is underlined and red



Target Attribute
    By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link.

    The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.

    The target attribute can have one of the following values:
        _self       - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
        _blank      - Opens the document in a new window or tab
        _parent     - Opens the document in the parent frame
        _top        - Opens the document in the full body of the window

Absolute URLs vs. Relative URLs
    Absolute URLs
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>
            <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>

    Relative URLs
            <a href="html_images.html">HTML Images</a>
            <a href="/test/test.html">CSS Tutorial</a>




Link Titles
    The title attribute specifies extra information about an element. 
    The information is most often shown as a tooltip text when the mouse moves over the element.

    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" title="Go to W3Schools HTML section">
        Visit our HTML Tutorial
    </a>



Link to an Email Address
    Use mailto: 
        inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program 
            (to let them send a new email):

    <a href="mailto:someone@example.com">
        Send email
    </a>




Create a Bookmark in HTML
    Bookmarks can be useful if a web page is very long.

    To create a bookmark 
        - first create the bookmark, 
        - then add a link to it.

    When the link is clicked, the page will scroll down or up to the location with the bookmark.

    First, use the id attribute to create a bookmark:
        <h2 id="C4">Chapter 4</h2>
    Then, add a link to the bookmark ("Jump to Chapter 4"), from within the same page:
        <a href="#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>

HTML Images
    The HTML <img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page.
    Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. 
    The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

    The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

    The <img> tag has two required attributes:
        src - Specifies the path to the image
        alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image

    Syntax
        <img src="url" alt="alternatetext">

    EX:
        <img src="img_chania.jpg" alt="Flowers in Chania">




Image Size - Width and Height
    <img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="500" height="600">




Images in Another Folder
    If you have your images in a sub-folder, you must include the folder name in the src attribute:
        <img src="/images/html5.gif" alt="HTML5 Icon" width="500" height="600">




Images on Another Server/Website
    Some web sites point to an image on another server.
    To point to an image on another server, you must specify an absolute (full) URL in the src attribute:
        <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/w3schools_green.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com">




Use an Image as a Link
    To use an image as a link, just put the <img> tag inside the <a> tag:

    <a href="test.html">
        <img src="smiley.gif" alt="HTML tutorial" width="200" height="150">
    </a>

HTML Favicon
    A favicon is a small image displayed next to the page title in the browser tab.

    Tip: A favicon is a small image, so it should be a simple image with high contrast.

    A favicon image is displayed to the left of the page title in the browser tab, like this:
    <head>
        <title>My Page Title</title>
        <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/images/favicon.ico">
    </head>
